# 0000. Adopt the repository standard

## Context

The repository needs documents and checks that work for a person and for an agent without extra context. The standard comes from a Copier template and is pinned in `.repo.yaml`.

## Decision

- Project rules live in `AGENTS.md`; `CLAUDE.md` imports it.
- Checks run through `mise run check` locally and in CI.
- Template files are protected; a deviation is recorded in `overrides` in `.repo.yaml` with a reason.
- Answers to the template questions change only through `copier update -a .repo.yaml --defaults --data <key>=<value>`.

## Rejected

- Free-form documentation without a fixed structure: drifts from the code.
- Checks that only run in CI: feedback arrives after the push.

## Consequences

- Template updates arrive as pull requests that bump `_commit` in `.repo.yaml`.
- Any markdown file outside the documented structure fails the check unless listed in `md_exceptions`.
